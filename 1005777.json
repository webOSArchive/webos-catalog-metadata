  "description": "New for 2021, webOS SimpleChat is a lightweight message board for the webOS community, hosted by webOS Archive -- or by you! More reliable than the Forums, with more history that IRC. Join the community in a new, and more dynamic way. Now supports all webOS devices, with native background sync and notifications.\r\n\r\nThe 1.0 release uses a different AppId than previous versions, in order to get access to more webOS capabilities. Unfortunately this means the old version will exist along-side the new one on your device. It is highly recommended that you delete the old version, and start fresh with this new branch.",
