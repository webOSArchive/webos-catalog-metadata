  "description": "Revisionist History Note - This is a brand new app for 2020, and the first ever (as far as I can tell) Hue controller for webOS.\r\nAn elegant night stand clock -- with a twist. It also doubles as a Hue light controller\r\nThe clock face is customizable, allowing you to select size, color, and night time dim mode. With a tap on the clock face, you can bring up the command bar, and switch to the lamp controller, with discrete controls for two lamps, and general controls for as many bulbs as you want. The lamp controller automatically fades back to the clock at your screen timeout, so you can roll over in bed and forget about it. ",
