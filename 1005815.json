  "description": "A basic Gemini Protocol browser for TouchPad.\r\nGemini is a new internet technology supporting an electronic library of interconnected text documents. That's not a new idea, but it's not old fashioned either. It's timeless, and deserves tools which treat it as a first class concept, not a vestigial corner case. Gemini isn't about innovation or disruption, it's about providing some respite for those who feel the internet has been disrupted enough already. Gemini is not out to change the world or destroy other technologies. It's out to build a lightweight online space where documents are just documents, in the interests of every reader's privacy, attention and bandwidth.",
