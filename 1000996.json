  "description": "Curator's Note - As of 2025, this still works for me, and I've removed the demo timeout. However, you're still limited to media formats the Touchpad already supports, and it requires changing some configuration on the Plex server:\n\n- Don't try to sign into the MyPlex service on your device -- it'll just screw up the app and you'll need to re-install.\n- If you're using a Proxy, turn it off.\n- Find the IP address of your TouchPad, then go into settings on your Plex Server, then Network, then Advanced. Find the textbox for 'List of IP addresses and networks that are allowed without auth'.\n- Enter the IP address of your TouchPad (or your entire subnet mask, like: 192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0) and Save.\n- Back in the app, go to Prefrences and add your server, then click Done.\n\nIf all goes well, you should see your folders in the left, and content on the right. I've only had success playing certain .MP4 files -- it seems like there's a bug in requesting transcoding from the server -- but a few of my videos play right away, and look great!",

  "versionNote": "The Plex application allows you to use your TouchPad to browse and play your media (video, photos and music) using the Plex Media Server installed on your Mac or PC. You can view online media from a variety of sources. ★★★ YOU MUST HAVE THE PLEX/NINE MEDIA SERVER INSTALLED AND RUNNING TO STREAM MEDIA ★★★ The media is streamed directly from your Mac or PC, and there is no need to convert before viewing. Requirements: • A TouchPad • An Intel Mac running Mac OS 10.5 or later, a Windows machine running Windows XP or later, or an Intel machine running Linux. • The Plex Media Server, which is part of the Plex Media Center, available at http://www.plexapp.com • In order to transcode to 720p , you need at least a 2.2GHz processor. Also note that streaming of DRM-protected content such as older music from the iTunes store, or video files purchased from iTunes, is not supported. Additionally, playing VIDEO_TS content and .ISO files is not supported.",
